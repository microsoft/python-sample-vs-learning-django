# Learning Django in Microsoft Visual Studio

Learn Python and Django using Microsoft Visual Studio for Windows!

## Install

* Visual Studio does not support python for MacOS or Linux. You can instead use an [extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python) for Visual Basic Code
* To install python on Windows: [VB 2017](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/installing-python-support-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2017#visual-studio-2017), [VB 2015](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/installing-python-support-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2017#visual-studio-2015), or [VB 2013 and Earlier](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/installing-python-support-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2017#visual-studio-2013-and-earlier)
* To test if everything worked, press ```alt + I``` to open the Python Interactive window, and then entering ```2 + 2```. You should see the output of ```4```.

## Let's Learn!

This repo contains three folders, the solutions to the Django tutorials that Microsoft offers ([docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/python](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/python))

### Get started with the Django web framework in Visual Studio

Follow the [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/python/learn-django-in-visual-studio-step-01-project-and-solution?view=vs-2017) and then you can check your answers/get unstuck in the [solutions](../master/BasicProject). These files should get you through steps 1-3.

### Use the full Django Web Project template

Once again, follow the [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/python/learn-django-in-visual-studio-step-04-full-django-project-template?view=vs-2017) and check your work with the [solutions](../master/DjangoWeb). These files should get you through steps 4 and 5.

### Use the Polls Django Web Project template

Finally, follow the [tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/python/learn-django-in-visual-studio-step-06-polls-django-web-project-template?view=vs-2017) and check your work with the [solutions](../master/DjangoPolls). This finishes off the Django tutorials that Microsoft offers. Good job!
